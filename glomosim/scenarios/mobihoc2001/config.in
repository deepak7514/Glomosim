# The folowing parameter represents the maximum simulation time. The numberd
# portion can be followed by optional letters to modify the simulation time.
# For example:
#        100NS   - 100 nano-seconds
#        100MS   - 100 milli-seconds
#        100S    - 100 seconds
#        100     - 100 seconds (default case)
#        100M    - 100 minutes
#        100H    - 100 hours
#        100D    - 100 days

# The following is a random number seed used to initialize  part of the seed of
# various randomly generated numbers in the simulation. This can be used to vary
# the seed of the simulation to see the consistency of the results of the
# simulation.

# The following two parameters stand for the physical terrain in which the nodes
# are being simulated. For example, the following represents an area of size 100
# meters by 100 meters. All range parameters are in terms of meters.
#
# Terrain Area we are simulating.

#
# The following parameter represents the number of nodes being simulated.

NUMBER-OF-NODES     100

#
#
#The following parameter represents the node placement strategy.
#- RANDOM: Nodes are placed randomly within the physical terrain.
#- UNIFORM: Based on the number of nodes in the simulation, the physical
#  terrain is divided into a number of cells. Within each cell, a node is
#  placed randomly.
#- GRID: Node placement starts at (0, 0) and are placed in grid format with
#  each node GRID-UNIT away from its neighbors. The number of nodes has to be
#  square of an integer.
#- FILE: Position of nodes is read from NODE-PLACEMENT-FILE. On each line of
#  the file, the x and y position of a single node is separated by a space.
#

#
# The following represent parameters for mobility. If MOBILITY is set to NO,
# than there is no movement of nodes in the model. For the RANDOM-DRUNKEN model,
# if a node is currently at position (x, y), it can possibly move to (x-1, y),
# (x+1, y), (x, y-1), and (x, y+1); as long as the new position is within the
# physical terrain. For random waypoint, a node randomly selects a destination
# from the physical terrain. It moves in the direction of the destination in 
# a speed uniformly chosen between MOBILITY-WP-MIN-SPEED and 
# MOBILITY-WP-MAX-SPEED (meter/sec). After it reaches its
# destination, the node stays there for MOBILITY-WP-PAUSE time period.
# The MOBILITY-INTERVAL is used in some models that a node updates its position
# every MOBILITY-INTERVAL time period. The MOBILITY-D-UPDATE is used that a node 
# updates its position based on the distance (in meters).

# PROPAGATION-LIMIT:
