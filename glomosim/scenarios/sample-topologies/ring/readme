This directory demonstrates how to set up a ring topology of 8 nodes with
FTP traffic (generic, meaning no feedback from the receiver, unlike from
tcplib) from node 0 to node 1, node 1 to node 2, node 2 to node 3,
node 3 to noe 4, node 4 to node 5, node 5 to node 6, node 6 to node 7 and
node 7 to node 0.
