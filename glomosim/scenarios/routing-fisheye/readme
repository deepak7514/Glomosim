The purpose of this file is to describe the Fisheye routing
parameters used in GlomoSim. There are 4 parameters in the fisheye
routing configuration file: 
<size of the scope>,  <time out for the neighboring nodes>,
<intra scope update interval> and <inter scope update interval>.
The value of these parameters are depend on mobility, node density,
transmission range etc. The description of these parameters are listed below.

<size of the scope>: this parameter specifies the scope radius of a node
in number of hops. 

<time out for the neighboring nodes>: If a node does not hear from a neighbor
specified by this value, the neighbor node will be deleted from the 
neighbor list. 

<intra scope update interval>: The update interval of sending the updates of the nodes
within the scope radius. 

<inter scope update interval>: The update interval of sending the updates of the nodes
outside the scope radius.
