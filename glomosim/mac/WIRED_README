Using Wired model in GlomoSim:
----------------------


2. In order to simulate WIRED, you must specify the following two 
   parameters in your configuration file:

    MAC-PROTOCOL   WIRED
    WIRED-LINK-FILE     file_name_for_wired_configuration_file
  
    ROUTING-PROTOCOL    STATIC
    STATIC-ROUTE-FILE   file_name_for_routing_files


The first selects WIRED model as the protocol to be simulated. The second
is a configuration file name for wired model which contains link configuration. 

And Current WIRED model support only static routing and point-to-point communication, to use static routing we need to set ROUTING-PROTOCOL to STATIC and fill in routing file name. 


Configuration files of WIRED Model 
------------------------------------

A list of configuration files for WIRED model are as follows 
    1. WIRED-LINK-FILE : 
       Link is half-duplex and directional, therefore to use bi-directional, 
       We should define both link. 

         Example: bin/wired_conf/wired_4.conf 
         Format  
              First column   : Source Address
              Secound column : Interface ID for this link of Source
              Third column   : Dest Addr.
              Fourth column  : Interface ID for this link of Destination
              Fifth column   : Bandwidth of this link 
              Sixth column   : Propagation delay of this link
    2. STATIC-ROUTE-FILE  :
         Example : bin/wired_conf/rtable_4.in 
         Format 
              First column   : Src Addr
              Second column  : Dest Addr
              Third column   : Next Hop Addr
              Fourth column  : Interface ID of Src to send message to Next Hop
  
         Node 0 (Interface ID 3) ===============>  Node 1 (Interface ID 2) 
          then route entry is that "0 1 1 3" 
         Node 0 (Interface ID 3) ===> Node 1 (Interface 2) ==> Node 2 (Interface 5)
           route entry for communication between node 0 and node 2 :
                   "0 2 1 3"
                   "1 2 2 2" 
         

 How to give Interface ID: 
   There is no restriction to give Interface ID from 0 to 29. 
   For one link, SRC and DEST give one Interface ID at each. 
   To fill in route information, Src uses outgoing Interface ID and Dest uses 
   incoming Interface ID.
